## Web Scraping the Largest Companies in the U.S. by Revenue
In this project, we’ll scrape data from a Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue, and we’ll store this data in a Pandas DataFrame. If we’re feeling adventurous, we’ll also export the data to a CSV file.
Understanding the largest companies by revenue can provide insights into market trends and economic health. This project will help us learn how to extract and manipulate data from web pages, which is a valuable skill in data analysis and business intelligence.
